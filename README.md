# RandomPairs
VERY simple program for pairing groups of people.

Program expects names.txt and oldGroups.txt in the same directory.  
Formatting of these files is very specific.  
I also have no idea what happens if duplicate names are involved.

names.txt:  
name  
name  
name  
name

oldGroups.txt:  
name,name  
name,name  
name,name
